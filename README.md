## Overview

I put together a storyboard that performed a sales analysis on a fictional company, FurniSure. Through the analysis, I looked through customers’ purchasing behaviors, evaluated sales across product categories, identified sales trends over time, and mapped the distribution of our sales across the U.S.. Using these insights, I highlighted potential opportunities for enhancing customer engagement, as well as finding regions and products that do well and don’t do so well.
